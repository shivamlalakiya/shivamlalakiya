I can state the following about myself based on my personal and professional experiences:</br>

- I make decisions based on data.</br>

- Every day, I educate and refine myself to become a better person.</br>

Meeting new people and obtaining new experiences are two of my favorite things. I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and consuming anything that can help me grow, broaden my horizons, or rethink my viewpoints on various topics.</br>
