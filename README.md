<h1>Hi, I'm Shivam 👋</h1>
<h4>I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston. I'm good at making data-driven judgments and enjoy working on data and Machine Learning related initiatives.</br></br>
I am currently working as a Data Scientist co-op at Ring Therapeutics, Collaborating with the Viral genomics team to develop Anello-backed programmable medicine. My main goal is to develop an NLP-based model for genes to predict tropism for creating viral vectors that can safely and effectively deliver therapies to target cells and tissues.</br></br>
I can state the following about myself based on my personal and professional experiences:</br>


- I'm great at leading projects and managing teams.</br>

- I am a skilled communicator.</br>

- I make decisions based on data.</br>

- Every day, I educate and refine myself to become a better person.</br>

Meeting new people and obtaining new experiences are two of my favorite things. I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and consuming anything that can help me grow, broaden my horizons, or rethink my viewpoints on various topics.</br>
